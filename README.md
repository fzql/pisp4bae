Winding-based Point Inclusion Tests for BAE-gons

## What is a BAE-gon?

A BAE-gon is a spherical polygon whose boundary does not contain antipodal
points. The following spherical polygons are BAE-gons:

- Spherical triangle (ST)

- Spherical polygons contained by an open hemisphere (HCSP)

## Usage Example

Please review `test.m`.

Call `pisp_shear` for the more optimal algorithm out of the two.
